# BOT Interview Experience

> I like the vision and concept of BOT Interview
> I think it is good at analyzing and rating a candidate's answer.
> It may help the companies for hiring for a specific feilds and giving more weightage to the questions that being more relevant for the role.


> I expected that it may ask me questions related to my previous answer
   > If I made a mistake or said an something wrong w.r.t a question, then it should confirm me and
     ask me next couple of questions so that I may realize that I may have given an wrong answer.
     
> During the interview I felt it boring, because there was no two way interactions. I had feeling, that it is just recording and sending the audio to the hiring team.
